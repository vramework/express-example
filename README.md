# express-middleware-starter

This repository demonstrates how to integrate **Vramework** into an Express-based Node.js server. It provides a starting point to explore Vramework’s function-first approach, type-safe routes, and flexible runtime abstraction—all while using familiar Express middleware and infrastructure.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Prepare the build:**
   ```bash
   yarn prebuild
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

Once the server is running, you can explore the routes and middleware logic to see how Vramework manages data handling, authentication, and validation behind the scenes.
